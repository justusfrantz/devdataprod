This application is developed as part of the requirement for the Coursera Developing Data Products Course. The **mtcars** dataset from **[R]** is used for the application to perform interactive data analysis from a set of user specified criterias as explained in the steps below:

### Steps
1. Specify the selling price of gasoline (USD/gallon).
2. Specify the limit of money to be spent on gasoline.
3. Specify the desired travel distance in miles.

### Additional Features:
User will be able to further refine the results by choosing the desired car charateristics as below:

1. Number of Cylinders
2. Displacement
3. Horsepower
4. Transmission
 
### Results
1. Table generated shows the list of cars that are able to achieve the desired travel distance as well as matching the other selected criterias. (The Download button is provided in order that user may save the table data into csv file.)
3. Corresponding Bar Chart is also shown based on the generated results.

Note:
The source codes for ui.R and server.R files are also available on the [GitHub repo] (https://github.com/justusfrantz/devdataprod)
